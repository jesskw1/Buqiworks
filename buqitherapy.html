            <h3>What is Buqi?</h3>
            <p>Buqi is a complete system of healing and self-healing with roots in <br>
            Chinese energy therapy going back over a thousand years, it is recorded <br>
            in Chinese history books as being a method by which some people could <br>
            heal others without touching.</p>
            <p>Dr Shen discovered through his own practice and teachings of Tai <br>
            jiquan and Qigong, that these profound methods of Qi cultivation <br>
            could also be applied to help heal others, with particular emphasis on <br>
            postural correction and treating emotional imbalance. These discoveries <br>
            became the basis for the development of the modern Buqi system. </p>
            <p>Buqi, as it is today, combines medical and healing knowledge from both <br>
            East and West aiming to treat the root causes of disease and thereby <br>
            release negative patterns, bringing the person back into balance and <br>
            enabling health to be restored naturally.</p>

            <h3>Buqi Treatment</h3>
            <p>During a Buqi treatment a patient may be asked to sit, stand or lie <br>
            down. After taking details of the patient’s health concerns and medical <br>
            history, the practitioner will diagnose and then begin to treat. All the  
            techniques are designed to both heal the patient and protect the <br>
            practitioner from absorbing the patient’s Binqi.</p>
            <p>Most techniques are therefore hands off and directing Binqi away from <br>
            both patient and therapist. A patient may experience a variety of <br>
            physical and emotional sensations such as the spinal column <br>
            lengthening, heat, itching, cold, the sensation of pain moving and <br>
            clearing, crying, laughing and often, afterwards, a sensation of deep <br>
            peace and relaxation.</p>
            <p> In addition to treatment, a patient may be given specific exercises, <br>
            empowering them to continue to improve and maintain their own health.</p>
            <p>Buqi treatments with me, are available in Bristol, Bath and the 
            surrounding areas. Please contact me for details. I also offer Buqi Tuina <br>
            massage for those who need hands on treatment.</p>

            <p>The number of treatments you need, and how often, depends on how  <br>
            easy it is to change the root cause of your health problem. <br></p>
            <p>The initial treatment will usually include some questioning to define <br>
            the history and development of the complaint. This will be followed by <br>
            Buqi Diagnosis and treatment. Your first consultation and treatment <br>
            usually lasts around 90 minutes and costs £60. Subsequent treatments <br>
            will usually last about an hour and cost £50. Block booking allows for  <br>
            further reduction in price. Home visits may be possible and in some case <br>
            it can be possible to treat remotely, online.</p>
