            <h3>What is Tai Chi?</h3>
            <p>Tai Chi was originally developed as a martial art. Different skills and <br>
            family styles were kept secret and available only within the families, who <br>
            were generally influential and wealthy. In the 1920â€™s the great proponents <br>
            of Tai chi began to focus more on the health elements for which Tai Chi is <br>
            now, certainly in the West, more popularly renowned as.</p>
            <p>I have studied Tai chi for thirty years and have been teaching since 2001. <br>
            In that time I have explored different short and long forms, Taiji 37 <br>
            (standing postures) Taiji forces, Sword form, Sanshou and Tuishou. </p>
            <p>Ultimately Tai Chi is alive, is beyond form and unlimited in its scope <br>
            to help us explore mind, body and spirit.</p>

            <h3>My Classes</h3>
            <p>My Tai Chi classes incorporate from, standing postures and some  <br>
            philosophy and prinicples. The martial element is acknowledged through <br>
            sometimes showing applicatiosns (in order to understand a movement)  <br>
            and some partner work. Depending upon the groupdifferent aspects of  <br>
            Tai Chi may be employed. I have worked with many groups where people <br>
            have limited movement and it is still possible to explore Tai Chi.</p>
            <p>New students will generally begin by working on posture and principles. <br>
            I also introduce exercises to help activate the dantian and begin the <br>
            understanding of energetics. Tai chi can be a lifetime study, but many <br>
            people come simply to unwind and practice it as a form of movement <br>
            therapy and release of stress and physical tension. Lightness and <br>
            humour keep the balance in this most profound of studies! </p>
            <p>Ultimately Tai Chi is alive, is beyond form and unlimited in its scope <br>
            to help us explore mind, body and spirit.</p>
