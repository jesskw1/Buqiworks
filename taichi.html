            <p>Tai Chi was originally developed as a martial 
                art. Different skills and family styles were 
                kept secret and available only within the 
                families, who were generally influential and 
                wealthy. In the 1920’s the great proponents <br>
                of Tai chi began to focus more on the health 
                elements for which Tai Chi is now, certainly 
                in the West, more popularly renowned as.</p>
                <p>I have studied Tai chi for thirty years 
                and have been teaching since 2001. In that 
                time I have explored different short and long 
                forms, Taiji 37 (standing postures) Taiji 
                forces, Sword form, Sanshou and Tuishou. </p>
                <p>Ultimately Tai Chi is alive, is beyond 
                form and unlimited in its scope to help us 
                explore mind, body and spirit.</p>
